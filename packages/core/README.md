---

Core runtime package of the [OPRA](https://oprajs.com) framework. Provides the execution engine, platform adapter base classes, service patterns, and infrastructure utilities that all OPRA adapters and services depend on.

## Features

- **Platform Adapter Base** — Abstract foundation for HTTP, Socket.IO, Kafka, RabbitMQ, and other transport adapters
- **Execution Context** — Request-scoped context carrying adapter, document, transport, and platform references
- **Service Pattern** — `ServiceBase` with context propagation and immutable `.for()` cloning
- **i18n Support** — Built-in internationalization with lazy-loading of resource bundles and localized error messages
- **Asset Cache** — WeakMap-based cache for automatic memory-safe asset lifecycle management
- **Event-Driven** — `AsyncEventEmitter`-based lifecycle hooks on both adapters and execution contexts

## Installation

```bash
npm install @opra/core
```

## Node Compatibility
